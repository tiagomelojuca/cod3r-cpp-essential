# cod3r-cpp-essential

Repo created for store all the exercises done over [CPP Essential Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-essencial/) from Cod3r.  
  
Please note that all exercises are very simple. The course's workload was just 13.5 hours, because I needed a basic C++ course, that could be done over one night only. I've done it over the night of 03/24/2021, aiming a specific job interview. The company called and made the appointment for the next morning, so I needed something that could bring some result quick.  
  
**I would like to clarify that I didn't lie at all**. I said in my curriculum that I don't have knowledge in C++, but they told me I did very well in the test, even better that some candidates who states to be C++ developers, so they called me anyway. I decided to enroll the course and do it over the night not for hiding a lie, but for proving them I'm ready for facing any challenge - specially because I do love C++, but unfortunally there are not many jobs for this tech in Brazil. I just would like to prove my disposal.
